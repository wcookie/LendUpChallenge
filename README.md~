# Wyatt's LendUp Challenge

## Requirements

The requirements for my project are Python 3.4.3 and pip.

## Setup

The easiest way to run my project would be with a virtual environment. Once you have this virtual environment set up with python 3.4.3, you can go the directory containing requirements.txt and type pip install -r requirements.txt in order to install the project's dependencies.

## Django Setup

run python manage.py migrate in order to get the database migrated, then run python manage.py runserver to run a local server on port 8000.

## Ngrok Setup

Ngrok is a very easy tool to get a local server connected with the web (and in this case Twilio). Once Ngrok is downloaded, it is as easy as typing ./ngrok http 8000 in order to get your django server connected to the web (and hence Twilio). 

## Project Setup

Once you have your Ngrok address, you want to put http://ngrokaddress.io/phonebuzz/gather into yout Twilio phone number's Phone Call get component.  In addition, replace the specific instance of ngrok I used for my url_string's in phonebuzz/views.py with your specific instance in order to get my project working properly wtih Twilio. Also in lendup/settings.py change the TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID and TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN.  

## Using my Project

Go to ngrokaddress.io/phonebuzz/call to instantiate a new call/delay and also to see the listing of past calls page.  On the listing page press the call button to re-make that call and play some Phone Buzz!

## Notes

I did not use an asynchronous task worker like celery.py in order to use the delay, and instead just used a sleep function.  If I had more time I would have taken time to celery, but I unfortunately had 3 midterms this past week so that wasn't entirely possible. 

If you have any more questions please eamil me at wyattcook2018@u.northwestern.edu

Thanks so much for the opportunity!
